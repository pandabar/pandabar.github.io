Here I keep some scripts and tutorials for different purposes.

### Praat Scripts

Check my [Github](https://github.com/pandabar/praat) for some Praat scripts. Most of them are simple and are annotated for a less experienced user.

### Tutorials

#### Tutorials (in Spanish) 

For complete beginners - part of the course Fonética del Español.

- [Praat Tutorial 1](tutorial1.pdf): Navigating the user interface (recording, the Objects window, the Picture window, TextGrids).
- [Praat Tutorial 2](tutorial2.pdf): Basic scripting (Opening files, TextGrid creation, Formant measurement, Table creation).
- [Excel Tutorial](tutorial_excel.pdf): Basic operations (descriptive statistics, Pearson's R, Chi-Square, T-test and ANOVA). I do not endorse nor recommend Excel -R is my software of choice for these purposes.

#### Tutorials (in English) 

Praat for specific purposes - part of a series of workshops given at Essex as a YERUN short-visit scholar

- [Praat Tutorial 1](praat1.pdf): Scripts for opening files with String lists, TextGrid generation, and querying
- [Praat Tutorial 2](hpraat2.pdf): Scripts for perceptual experiments (vowel resythesis, synthesis from scratch, the Experiment interface).

#### Other things

- This is a [decision tree](Statstree.svg) that I created for a Statistics course I co-taught with [Bettina Braun](https://www.ling.uni-konstanz.de/en/research-group-for-phonetics-and-general-linguistics/prof-dr-bettina-braun/) some time ago. It is massive (hence the .svg format) and yet it is far from being remotely comprehensive. Nevertheless, it does serve as a guide for those who do not have a strong background in statistics but are willing to dive in.
