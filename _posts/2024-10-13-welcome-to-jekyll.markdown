I had my website on [Github](https://github.com), which I kept updating manually. Since I had plenty of verbose HTML, at some point I just stopped updating it. So now it seems that with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) I can do things slightly faster while still on GitHub, but the learning curve so far has been quite steep. The great thing about it is that I can use Markdown for both pages and blogging, which is a wonderful thing. Let's see how this goes from now on.
