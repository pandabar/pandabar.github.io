<h1 id="praat-scripting-task-oriented">Praat scripting</h1>
<p>Hello! Welcome to my Praat course. I wrote the first version of this course in 2019 for my students at Konstanz. Most of them had a background in Phonetics, Praat (i.e. having used the GUI), and/or computer programming and thus I wrote it taking that into account. The second version had students without such background and it became obvious to me that the next version of this course will need to cater for those students as well. The third version (current) included the participation of Moritz Jakob as a teaching assistant, who also contributed to the course structure by adding further exercises and making the course progress smoother.</p>
<p>That being said, here is what this course will offer:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A task-based approach to Praat scripting: I tried to focus on a very general set of tasks, which in my experience are the most common ones in Praat. If you need to learn how to, say, create a script to open a set of files in one go, or create a basic KlattGrid, this will probably help.</p></li>
<li><p>Less-explored things to do with Praat are those related to speech synthesis, which I do cover here, though at a basic level. Manipulation of sounds (pitch, formants) as well as synthesis from scratch, are shown here.</p></li>
<li><p>Some topics include YouTube videos where I explain a bit how a given script works.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>What this course does <strong>not</strong> offer (so far) is content for complete beginners who have never used Praat before (not even with the GUI), or have little to no previous knowledge in phonetics. However, some of these have been scattered throughout the course, at my students’ request. If you would like me to provide more of these I am happy to take your request, but I can’t promise anything time-wise: While I do check my emails constantly, your request might take some time for me to respond.</p>
