<!--l. 31--><p class="noindent" >Perception has been studied from diﬀerent perspectives. Questions related to phonetics have to do with, for instance, how sensitive listeners are to a given acoustic parameter. In phonology, questions relate to how the perception of a given acoustic cue can be associated to the recognition of a certain category. Just as in production, the research questions can vary from the concrete to the abstract.
</p><!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >  An important aspect that you might want to take into account is that <strong>perceptual experiments are impossible to modify post hoc</strong>. That is, if your research question went through slight changes or if your stimuli did not turn out how you wanted, you will have to gather new data. With production this situation might be salvageable if you have for instance a long interview with each subject.
</p><!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >  That being said, perception experiments have an advantage: you don’t need to deal with annotation, which can be very time consuming; the data will be ready for analysis.

</p>
  <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.1 </span> <a 
 id="x1-30002.1"></a>Categorization</h4>
<!--l. 39--><p class="noindent" >Categorization (identifcation/labelling) is perhaps one of the most common perceptual tasks in phonology. In each trial, the subject is exposed to a single stimulus and is asked to give a response to the question: “What sound did you hear?”
</p><!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >  Answers can be given in two ways:
     </p><dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   1. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Forced-choice task: the subject chooses an answer from predetermined options;
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   2. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Multiple-choice, where the subject can choose more than one option among a series of
     possible answers; or
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   3. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Open-choice, where the subject can provide a free response after having heard the stimulus.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" >For 1 and 2, several options are available. The simplest option is to use an orthographic transcription, for example: ”the vowel in the word <span
class="cmti-10x-x-109">pin</span>”. But your research question might want to avoid any
orthographic biases, in which case you can use a picture of a lexical item with the sound in question (i.e. a picture of a pin.)
</p>
  <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.2 </span> <a 
 id="x1-40002.2"></a>Discrimination</h4>
<!--l. 49--><p class="noindent" >Discrimination has usually been considered to be a less phonological task, and more related to phonetic aspects of perception. Discrimination tasks present more than one stimulus per trial, where several paradigms are possible:
     </p><dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   1. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem"><strong>AX task</strong>: the subjects are asked to answer whether two sounds are the same or diﬀerent.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   2. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">An <strong>AXB task</strong> presents three stimuli, where two of them are the same (either A and X or X and B). The subject is asked to pair those that are considered to be the same. If the stimulus to be discriminated is after the reference stimuli, the experiment is called an ABX task.
     Conversely, in an XAB task the stimulus in question comes before the referential ones.
     All of these tasks have been considered to aim at different types of processing. It has been argued that AX tasks elicit acoustically-driven responses, while ABX, XAB, and AXB
     would be able to elicit phonologically-driven responses, due to the need for the listener to resort to phonological categories in order to group the stimuli.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 57--><p class="indent" >  Something to take into account when designing discrimination experiments is the Interstimulus Interval (ISI), that is, the amount of silence time between the stimuli. If you are aiming to a more acoustic research question, the you might want to use a shorter ISI. If on the other hand your question is more phonological, then you will need to lengthen the time so that your subject relies more on
abstract categories than short-term memory.
</p>
  <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.3 </span> <a 
 id="x1-50002.3"></a>Rating</h4>
<!--l. 60--><p class="noindent" ><strong>Ratings</strong> are usually performed as a Likert scale, where the subject listens to a given stimulus and is then asked to rate it in terms of how good an exemplar of a given category it is, where <strong>1 = bad exemplar</strong> and <strong>5 = good exemplar</strong>. Depending on your research question, you can also use a 7-point scale, 9-point scale, etc. but take into account that there is <em>a slight bias towards not using the extreme values!</em>
</p><!--l. 62--><p class="indent" >  Likewise, you can make a crossover between discrimination and ratings: you can ask
people to rate a pair of stimuli (that is, an AX paradigm) in terms of how similar/dissimilar
they are. This will give you a more ﬁne-grained idea of what people perceive as same or
diﬀerent.
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
</p><!--l. 64--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
  <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.4 </span> <a 
 id="x1-60002.4"></a>Categorical perception</h4>
<!--l. 66--><p class="noindent" >Categorical perception has been understood as a phenomenon by which perception along a continuum of acoustic values abruptly changes. If we have a 10-step continuum between /ba/ and /da/ (that is, we give the same stimulus gradually different locus values) and we pair them so that subjects discriminate between step 1 and step 2, then step 2 and step 3, and so on, the responses will be mostly ”same”, except at some point whereresponses will be ”diﬀerent”; after reaching this point, responses are ”same” again. This point in which discrimination is higher coincides with the point where the same subjects will stop categorizing the same 10 tokens as /ba/ and start perceiving them as /da/ in an identiﬁcation task. In sum, this is two tasks (identiﬁcation and discrimination) with the same stimuli.

  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3 </span> <a

<!--l. 31--><p class="noindent" >In the previous weeks we have learned how to prepare stimuli for perceptual research with Praat. Now,
a diﬀerent problem arises: how do I present my stimuli to the participants? Here you have several
options, including external platforms such as LimeSurvey (these are very useful if you’d like to
perform experiments via web). However, testing perception online is a bit tricky as you are not in
control of the participant’s behaviour: did he/she take a toilet break while responding? Was he/she
interrupted by someone else?
</p><!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >  If you want to run your experiment in a controlled setting, then you can use the Praat Experiment
interface. It won’t allow for designing very sophisticated experiments, but you can deﬁnitely run the

     within each block; so for instance, you could have <span

     0 times in block 2.

<!--l. 132--><p class="noindent" >Lines 21 to 27 set the text throughout the experiment. Each line break in the script equals one line

  <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.2.6 </span> <a

<!--l. 135--><p class="noindent" >You can also let your participants replay a given sound. Line 28 sets the maximum number of times
that they can play a given sound. Line 29 sets the coordinates for the replay button. The coordinates
work in the usual X-Y plot, where the origin is on the lower left corner and the values go from 0 to 1.
The ﬁrst two values are the X-axis and the other two the ones for the Y-axis. The ﬁrst set of quotation
marks set the font size for the button.
</p><!--l. 137--><p class="indent" >  Likewise, you can have an OK button, which conﬁrms the participant’s answer; and an ”oops”
button, which allows the participant to chance their answer (Lines 30-31).

<!--l. 139--><p class="noindent" >Finally, we get to set the response buttons. Since this experiment has 2 tasks per trial, we will have
two sets of buttons. </p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">The ﬁrst set of buttons are the responses to the identiﬁcation task. We decided to give
     only two choices, but this is of course uo to you. Line 33 sets the number of possible
     choices, and then Lines 34-35 give the coordinates for each button. The ﬁrst text is what
     will appear on the screen; the number 40 is the font size. The ”e” and ”a” will be the way
     in which the responses will appear on the results table generated by Praat.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">And ﬁnally, the same holds for the goodness categories. We gave the participants 5 options.</li></ul>

 id="x1-110004"></a>The procedure</h3>
<!--l. 146--><p class="noindent" >Now, how do we administer this experiment? First, you can run it in any computer. Recall
that Praat can be portable too, so you can have everything in a USB stick and it will
run.
</p><!--l. 148--><p class="indent" >  As we mentioned earlier, you will need to open the experiment script with the <span
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Read from ﬁle </span>option.
If everything is ok, then the Objects window will show you the <span
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Run </span>button. Click and the experiment
will start running in a pop-up window.
</p><!--l. 150--><p class="indent" >  After the experiment took place, you may simply close the pop-up window. The Objects
window will have an <span
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Extract Results </span>option. Click and a <span
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">ResultsMFC experiment </span>object will
appear; you may rename it with the participant’s name. After that, click on <span
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Collect to</span>
<span
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Table</span>. This will create a table with the results, which you can then save to your computer.
</p>

  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">6 </span> <a
 id="x1-90005"></a>Homework</h3>
<!--l. 136--><p class="noindent" >Try generating a 5-step continuum with diﬀerent vowel pairs: one where the acoustic distance is bigger and one where it is smaller (for example, /i-u/ and /æ- <span
class="tipa-10x-x-109">ɑ</span>/) and set up an AX experiment with Praat. Reflect: How sensitive are you to the changes in each continuum step? On ILIAS, upload a .zip file called <strong>experiment_lastname.zip</strong> where you have your folder called <span
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Sounds</span> with either one of the sound continua (I suggest creating a /i-u/ continuum and pair them using the script in section 4), and the <span
class="cmti-10x-x-109">experiment.praat</span> file. You don't need to send the script in section 4; just the already concatenated sounds in the corresponding folder are enough.</p>
