I have some teaching stuff here.

#### Praat scripting

You can access my Praat course [here](praatcourse/index.html).

#### English morphology

I developed the slides with Quarto for Revealjs, whose PDF output is pretty ugly. [Here](morphology.html) you can access the original files. The course is pretty much verbatim from Lieber's _Introducing Morphology_ and Haspelmath and Sims' _Understanding Morphology_.
