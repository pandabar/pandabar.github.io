Hi! I am an Academic Collaborator at the [University of Konstanz](https://uni-konstanz.de). Originally a teacher of Spanish language and literature, at some point I decided to study a Master's degree in Applied Linguistics at my [alma mater](https://www.udec.cl/), which I finished in 2011. A couple of years later I started a PhD in Linguistics at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk) (UK), which I completed in 2018. My main areas of interest are Spanish phonetics and phonology, Second Language Acquisition, speech perception and loan phonology. I did some work in AI and CALL/ICALL during my days as a Master's student at UdeC, but nowadays my focus in on L2 speech perception and production.

If you wish to contact me, feel free to drop me a line at fernandabarrientos(at)gmail(dot)com.
